# Music Maker

A small app built in JavaScript that lets the user create short beat loops (10 notes long).

## Features:

- Clean UI with smooth animations that show what instrument is being played and when.
- Clap, Kick, Snare, Tom, Hi-Hat and Cowbell instruments.
- Selecting between many variants of each instrument (808, electro, acoustic etc.).
- Muting each instrument individually.
- Pausing and unpausing at any point in the loop.
- Manually select whatever tempo the user wants, from 20bpm up to 300bpm.
